XOAD is a PHP based AJAX/XAP object oriented framework that allows you to create richer web applications.
 
XOAD, formerly known as NAJAX, has many benefits:

 - it uses JSON and native PHP serialized objects to communicate,
 - special attention has been paid to security,
 - supports server side events (observation),
 - client side events (XOAD Events),
 - server and client extensions,
 - HTML manipulation (extension),
 - Caching (extension).
 
And more:

 - each class, method and variable is documented,
 - easy tutorials to get started using XOAD.
