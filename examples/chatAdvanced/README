If you would like to use the new chat example you should
run the following SQL code in your database:

CREATE TABLE `xoad_chat_users`
(
	`id`		BIGINT			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL	AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`nick`		VARCHAR(30)					NOT NULL,
	`time`		INT				UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),

	INDEX(`time`)
);

To change connection settings open Client.class.php and
edit them in getConnection(...).
