INSTALL
--------

1) Make sure XOAD has both read and write access to
   the /var directory. You should chmod it to 777.

2) For security reasons, please edit the XOAD_SERIALIZER_SKIP_STRING
   constant (in 'config/xoad.config.php', line 43). Append
   '<![xoadSerializer:skipString[' with some random string (at least
   10 characters long). Example:

   define('XOAD_SERIALIZER_SKIP_STRING', '<![xoadSerializer:skipString[-envLOOPwHaT-[');

3) If you would like to use the MySQL provider for the
   Client Event System (XOAD Events) you should run the
   following SQL code in your database:

   CREATE TABLE `xoad_events`
   (

   	`id`		BIGINT			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL	AUTO_INCREMENT,
   	`event`		VARCHAR(100)				NOT NULL,
   	`className`	VARCHAR(100)				NOT NULL,
   	`filter`	VARCHAR(100)				NULL,
   	`sender`	TEXT						NULL,
   	`data`		TEXT						NULL,
   	`time`		DOUBLE			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,
   	`endTime`	DOUBLE			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,

   	PRIMARY KEY(`id`),

   	INDEX(`event`, `className`, `filter`, `time`, `endTime`)

   );

   If you're going to use another provider (not MySQL) please refer to
   the README or INSTALL file included in it. Note, that some providers
   do not require installation.

4) If you would like to use the MySQL provider for XOAD_Cache
   you should run the following SQL code in your database:

   CREATE TABLE `xoad_cache` (

   	`id`		VARCHAR(32)				NOT NULL,
   	`expire`	INT			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,
   	`data`		TEXT					NOT NULL,

   	PRIMARY KEY(`id`),

   	INDEX(`expire`)

   );

   If you're going to use another provider (not MySQL) please refer to
   the README or INSTALL file included in it. Note, that some providers
   do not require installation.
